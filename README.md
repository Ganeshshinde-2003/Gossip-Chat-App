## Advantage ⚡️

One of the advantages of using the GOSSIP Chat App over other chat apps, such as WhatsApp, is that it is optimized for poor internet connections. In GOSSIP, even if you have a poor internet connection, you can still send and receive messages without having to wait for the connection to improve. This is possible because GOSSIP uses a real-time database powered by Firebase, which allows for immediate message delivery, regardless of the quality of your internet connection.
